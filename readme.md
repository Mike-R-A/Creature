# Creature
## An attempt at some basic learning AI

- The creatures (the pink one is graphed, the yellow ones are not) will attempt to keep their wellbeing at 100 by eating the other blobs.
- The different blobs have different nutritional values, positive and negative.
- Initially the creatures do not know which blob is of what value and must learn by associating what it can smell (it can smell colour) with the change in its wellbeing.
- You can add extra blobs by pressing the r,g or b keys.
