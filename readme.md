# Creature
## An attempt at some basic learning AI using p5.js and typescript

- The creature (a gold blob) will attempt to keep the bar on the right at 100 by eating the other blobs.
- The different blobs have different nutritional values, positive and negative.
- Initially the creature does not know which blob is of what value and must learn by associating what it can smell (it can smell colour) with the change in its wellbeing.
- You can add extra blobs by pressing the r,g or b keys.
